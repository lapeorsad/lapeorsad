- Hey, I’m lapeorsad. 
- I am mere noob at everything. Barely experienced at Python, understand nothing in plain regular degular java and I enjoy reading well defined documentation.
- Trying to learn and mess around with Arch Linux at the moment, if this goes badly and it will, I will move back with manjaro.

- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that accepts me.
- How to reach me ... please no.
